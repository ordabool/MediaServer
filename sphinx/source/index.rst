Welcome!
===============================================

Welcome to the documentation of my personal media server project. 

Here I will attempt to explain how the solution works, how to set everything up, and ways to improve the project in the future. 

I hope that by reading these docs the project will become clear, but feel free to contact me at or.dabool@gmail.com for any question.

Enjoy!
